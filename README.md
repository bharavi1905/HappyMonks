Given a specific activation function
g(x) = k0 + k1x (1)
and categorical cross-entropy loss, design a Neural Network on Banknote, MNIST or IRIS data where the activation function parameters k0; k1 are learned from the data you choose  from one of the above-mentioned data sets. Your solution must include the learnable parameter values i.e. final k0; k1 values at the end of training, a plot depicting changes in k0; k1 at each epoch, training vs test loss, train vs. test accuracy and a Loss function plot.

A technical report containing implementation details (algorithm, initial settings such as sampling the parameters k0; k1 from some distribution, parameter updates on epochs, final parameter values at the end of training, train vs test loss, train and test accuracy, F1-Score, plot of the loss function vs. epochs, Code base hosted on github linked in the report)â€“Maximum 3 pages.
